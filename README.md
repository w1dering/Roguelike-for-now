This is a small project developed by Ryan and Una. It was created using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), an open-source library that streamlines the process of game development and creating graphical interfaces in many languages.

**Please check out the other branches (develop and why), as they are far more updated than the main branch**

Currently, we haven't figured out how to export the game, so you can't run it if you download it

FEATURES:
- a ball
  - it can move, jump, dash and shoot rectangles
- gravity
- moving platforms
- messy code
